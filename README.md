## Section 1 - HTML

Breezing through this section as it's all review for me and I might pick up something new.

Completed HTML CCA test and completeled the HTML challenge

## Section 2 - CSS

A lot of this is also review for me, although I'm sure I'm going to learn some new stuff here. I did for the HTML stuff.
