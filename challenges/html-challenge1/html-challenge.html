            <p>My name is Sheena, I'm in the middle of a career change right now. Not long completed my Diploma in Software Development and now looking for work as a developer.</p>

            <p>But this page isn't about that. This page is about my favourite video games because, yes, I like video games.</p>

            <sub>I would like it noted that I was trying ot make this page while a cat walked all over my laptop. All typos are most definitely <em>not</em> my own. Blame the cat.</sub>

                    <p>I actually blame my cousin for this one. She recommended it to me. I tried the first one and thought it was okay (but not great). It took me three months to get through it (I was <em>not</em> a good player back then!).</p>
                    <p>Then I started on Assassin's Creed 2, with Ezio Auditore da Firenze, and absolutely loved it. I've played every game over the last few years, but Ezio still holds a special place in my heart.</p>
