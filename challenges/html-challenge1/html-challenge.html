                My name is Sheena, I'm in the middle of a career change right now (I was an English as a Second Language teacher). Not long completed my Diploma in Software Development and now looking for work as a developer.

                But this page isn't about that. This page is about my favourite video games because, yes, I like video games.

                    <h4>How it Started</h4>

                    <p>I actually blame my cousin for this one. She recommended it to me. I tried the first one and thought it was okay (but not great). It took me three months to get through it (I was <em>not</em> a good player back then!).</p>

                    <p>Then I started on Assassin's Creed 2, with Ezio Auditore da Firenze, and absolutely loved it. I've played every game over the last few years, but Ezio still holds a special place in my heart.</p>

                    <h4>Why Assassin's Creed</h4>

                    <p>I think it's the stories? I love a good story and the AC games definitely tell a good story.</p>

                    <p>Of course, this doesn't mean I love <em>all</em> the AC games. <strong>*cough*</strong> Unity (glitchy glitchy mess of a game) <strong>*cough*</strong>.</p>

                        This one's all on me. I saw a brief clip of the game in a video I was watching on Youtube. It looked interesting, so I did a quick search and watched a trailer...which turned into another trailer, which turned into another... until, before I knew it,
                        I'd spent a couple of hours watching clips and trailers of this game I'd never heard of!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I decided to buy the game when I spotted EB Games having an end of financial year sale, dropping the nearly $100 game down to $57. I haven't looked back since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've been playing for over 200 hours now, and I <em>still</em> haven't finished the game! I've finished the main quest (but still haven't cleared the main map), the <em>Hearts of Stone</em> DLC, but am only about 1/3 of the way
                        through the <em>Blood & Wine</em> DLC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've also recently started playing Witcher 2, just to see if it's as good...it's not.

                        The story really pulls you in! Plus there's just so much to do in the game. The map itself is massive, and there's so many little side quests. The DLCs, from any other game studio, could be classified as separate games themselves. <em>Hearts of Stone</em>                        took me a good 30 hours to complete. <em>Blood & Wine</em>, well I've already been going for about the same amount of time and I've barely scratched the surface of it. I've probably got a good 40 hours left just to complete the
                        main storyline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, it's visually stunning!
